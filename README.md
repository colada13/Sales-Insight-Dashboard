Understanding the Data and Formulating KPIs :
The following information can be gained from the data

No. of units sold, states shipped to, categories in which goods are sold.
We visualise this as number cards which can give an one look insight to the data

Analysis of revenue based on different factors can also be interpreted from the data. 
1. Revenue by Category
2. Revenue by Region
3. Revenue by State 

The visualisations are a pie chart to show what the contribution of each segment as a percentage of the whole.

4. Revenue by Month
This is a time series visualisation which helps one understand the general health (growth or decline) trend of the sales data.

We can further filter the data on the basis of more detailed information using the slicers for:
Payment Type 
Sales Person
Customer Name

The interactive dashboard thus will help one do in-depth analysis of data based on multiple factors.
